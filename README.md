# Naive Bayes Spam Emails Project

In this article, I will walk you through a project on spam email classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm. We will go through the various stages of the project, including importing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training and prediction, and finally evaluating the model's performance.

## Importing Data

The first step in any data analysis project is to import the necessary data. In this case, we will be working with a dataset containing email messages labeled as either spam or not spam. This dataset will serve as our training data for the Naive Bayes classifier.

## EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the data. To start, we can use the `info()` function to get an overview of the dataset, including the number of samples and the data types of each feature. This information will help us understand the data better and plan our preprocessing steps accordingly.

Additionally, we can create a countplot to visualize the distribution of spam and not spam emails in the dataset. This plot will give us an idea of the class balance and the proportion of spam emails in our data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an essential step in any machine learning project. It involves transforming the raw data into a format suitable for training the model. In the case of text data like emails, the following preprocessing steps are commonly applied:

1. Data Vectorization using CountVectorizer: To convert the text data into a numerical format, we use the CountVectorizer. It tokenizes the text and builds a vocabulary of unique words, assigning a count to each word in each email. This process creates a matrix representation of the text data, which is used as input for the Naive Bayes classifier.

2. Splitting Data: After vectorizing the data, we split it into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the Naive Bayes model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

## Model Training and Prediction

With the preprocessed data, we can proceed to train the Naive Bayes classifier. Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for text classification tasks, as it assumes independence between features. We fit the model to the training data, allowing it to learn the patterns and characteristics of spam and not spam emails.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen email data. The model will assign a probability score to each email, indicating the likelihood of it being spam or not spam.

## Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of our Naive Bayes classifier, we can use several evaluation metrics:

- Accuracy Score: This metric calculates the overall accuracy of the model, which is the proportion of correctly classified emails.

- Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This information is useful for understanding the types of errors the model makes.

- Classification Report: The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (spam and not spam). These metrics give insights into the model's performance on individual classes.

In our project, the Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 98.84%, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and not spam emails.

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully built a Naive Bayes classifier to classify spam and not spam emails. We went through the stages of importing the data, performing EDA, preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The achieved accuracy of 98.84% demonstrates the efficacy of the Naive Bayes algorithm for spam email classification.
